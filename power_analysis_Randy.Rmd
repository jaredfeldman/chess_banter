## Justification for simulation variables
We performed a pilot test of 10 games with our chess bot that plays at a consistent 1000 level against real opponents on lichess.com.  We found that the opponents played at an average of 72% accuracy and had a 12.3 standard deviation in their accuracy rating.  We used these values in our power analysis.
