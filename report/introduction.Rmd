# Introduction

## Theory
Psychological pressure can have an impact on sporting excellence[^1]. One key mechanism through which individuals experience psychological pressure is by engaging in banter with their opponent. Banter, which is characterized as playful teasing and competitive remarks, has the potential to have both positive and negative influences on performance[^2].  On the one hand, banter can distract individuals from performing their best by diverting focus away from the game.  On the contrary, banter could lead to increased engagement and motivation, potentially resulting in one being in a heightened state which is commonly referred to as being “in the zone”[^3]. 

In fact, according to a study by McDermott and Lachlan[^4], the targets of trash talk were motivated to outperform their opponents and frequently did outperform them.

## Concept Under Investigation
Research on the influence of conversation, banter, trash-talking, and bullying on an opponent's in-game performance is currently limited. Notably, trash-talking exhibits gender and sport-type variations, being more prevalent among men and in contact sports compared to non-contact sports, as evidenced by Kniffin and Palacio (2018)[^5]. However, the impact of athlete anonymity, whether masked or not, remains inconclusive in existing studies. In the context of online gaming, where the online uninhibited behavior effect is commonly experienced, we aim to delve deeper into the effects in non-contact sports (in our case chess) and anonymity.

Recent studies highlight the normalization of online trash-talking[^6], despite its potential negative repercussions for the recipient. Our investigation seeks to contribute valuable insights into banter's perceived impact on gameplay, with the ultimate goal of fostering a less toxic online gaming environment. By exploring the dynamics of online interactions, our research aspires to provide a nuanced understanding of how conversational elements may shape the gaming experience and influence player behaviors, contributing to a more positive and inclusive gaming community.

## Hypothesis
Our null hypothesis is defined as follows: Engaging in online chess chat is unlikely to influence the playing accuracy of opponents.

We posit that encountering a text designed to provoke a challenge from an opponent may create a sense of perceived rivalry, ultimately enhancing their gameplay accuracy and performance.
