# Introduction

## Theory
Psychological pressure can have an impact on sporting excellence (Johnson and Taylor, 2018). One key mechanism through which individuals experience psychological pressure is by engaging in banter with their opponent. Banter, which is characterized as playful teasing and competitive remarks, has the potential to have both positive and negative influences on performance.  On the one hand, banter can distract individuals from performing their best by diverting focus away from the game.  On the contrary, banter could lead to increased engagement and motivation, potentially resulting in one being in a heightened state which is commonly referred to as being “in the zone” (Murphy and White, 1995). In fact, according to a study by McDermott and Lachlan (McDermott and Lachlan, 2021), the targets of trash talk were motivated to outperform their opponents and frequently did outperform them.

## Concept Under Investigation
There is limited research around the impact that banter, trash-talking, or even bullying may have on an opponent’s in-game performance. Trash-talking has been found to be more prevalent among men vs. women, as well as in contact sports vs. non-contact sports (Kniffin and Palacio 2018). However, studies have not found any differences between whether an athlete feels anonymous (e.g., masked) or not. Given we will be engaging in online gaming, we will further investigate the impact in non-contact sports and anonymity, as many experience the online disinhibition effect (Wikipedia) when engaging with other people online.

Studies have found that online trash-talking has become normalized (Beres et al. 2021), even though it could have a negative impact on the recipient. We hope that our research will shed light on banter’s perceived impact on game play, and curb behaviors towards a less toxic online gaming environment.
