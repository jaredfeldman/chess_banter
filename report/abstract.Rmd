# Abstract

This study investigates the influence of online chat, specifically banter and friendly conversation, on the performance of chess players. Drawing on psychological pressure theories and previous research on trash-talking in sports, the study explores the potential effects of chat interactions on gameplay accuracy and player behavior. The research employs a chess bot, Maia, and integrates the OpenAI API, ChatGPT, to engage players in dynamic conversations. Utilizing the lichess.org platform for experiments, the study employs a between-subjects experimental design, randomizing opponents into control, placebo, and treatment groups. The null hypothesis posits that engaging in online chess chat is unlikely to influence opponent playing accuracy. The experimental design involves a preliminary phase with predefined phrases and a main experiment using ChatGPT for dynamic interactions. The results reveal no significant impact on player performance in terms of the targeted outcome variables. Despite observing a slight increase in opponents' average move time, this effect is not statistically significant. The study concludes that, contrary to expectations, online chess chat does not significantly affect player performance, emphasizing the need for a nuanced understanding of the role of chat in fostering a positive gaming environment. The findings contribute to discussions on toxicity in online gaming, promoting a more positive and inclusive gaming community.
